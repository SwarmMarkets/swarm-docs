# Introduction

We live in times where technology enables individuals to come together in swarms to express collective behavior which is self-organized, decentralized, networked and adaptive. With Swarm we aim to support these swarms in their expression of collective financial behavior.

Swarm is a blockchain platform that brings unique digitization and trading solutions to the world of traditional finance. It is the first organization in the world to offer digitized US treasury bills and Apple stock via a compliant and decentralized platform. Day to day, we work with real-world-asset owners to tokenize collateral and build trading infrastructure in a compliant way. Issuers that need compliance guarantees to build secondary markets of tokenized securities, including fixed income products, choose to partner Swarm.Swarm is a hybrid, embracing the advantages of blockchain-trading - flexibility, speed and efficiency - and pairing it with the trust and asset-range typically enjoyed by traditional exchanges. Swarm aims to integrate TradFi with DeFi so that everything becomes "Fi". For more information, visit the [website](http://swarm.com/).

Our mission is to enable customers to conduct transactions with blockchain-based tokens representing all asset classes easily, cost-effectively and securely, in a regulatory-safe environment, while preserving the core benefits of DeFi: peer-to-peer, self-custody, on-chain transparency, and networked liquidity.

By introducing these new tools, integrations and asset onramps, we believe we can contribute to a growth of the DeFi ecosystem by 10-100x.

Imagine a single market with assets from the traditional finance world paired with the power of DeFi applications. Trading crypto assets (BTC/ETH/DAI) with asset tokens (gold, real estate or other real world assets) and with tokenized stocks and more... For the first time ever, you can trade a market like gold/BTC in a unified market infrastructure.

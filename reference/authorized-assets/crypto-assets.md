### Wrapped Ether (wETH) <a href="#weth" id="weth"></a>

Ether (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum Network, a decentralized open-source blockchain system. Fees and rewards for processing transactions on the Ethereum Network are denominated in ETH. Ethereum works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.

ETH trades via an ERC-20 smart contract for an equal token called wETH. wETH is needed to be able to trade ETH for other ERC-20 tokens on decentralized platforms because ETH was built before the ERC-20 standard existed and does not conform to its own ERC-20 standard.

The non-profit Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015.

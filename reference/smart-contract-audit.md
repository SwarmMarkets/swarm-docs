## Risks <a href="#risks" id="risks"></a>

* It is important for users to understand that Swarm has the ability to change the proxy implementation for most core contracts on the Swarm protocol.
* This project is still in beta and we advise caution - please do not put more into our contracts than you are prepared to lose if a vulnerability is found and exploited.
* We are confident in the security of our contracts and have sought third-party opinions, but since the project is new and has not received extensive scrutiny from hackers or auditing firms we can not be absolutely certain that no mistakes were overlooked.

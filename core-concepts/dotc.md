# dOTC

Swarm’s decentralized over-the-counter trading (dOTC) service enables institutions to carry out large transactions on the Blockchain.

High-volume swap activity is increasing significantly. Large volume-based trading OTC for digitized assets is costly, complex and often difficult to execute. Our dOTC service empowers institutions and retail investors to use a block-trade smart contract in place traditional OTC trading.

#### How it works

The peer-to-peer (P2P) contract will facilitate high-value transactions, reduce slippage and remove counterparty risk, as all users on Swarm are verified.

Despite high value trades being on the rise, to date, there has not been an institutional-grade trading tool available.

Swarm clients place a buy or sell order into the market for eligible assets, using the dOTC contract. Much like an escrow account, assets held by the smart contract can only be redeemed to a crypto wallet once all terms have been fulfilled.

The smart contract replaces the need for financial intermediaries, typically found in complex and costly OTC trading arrangements in traditional financial markets.

#### How can I access dOTC?

In order to use dOTC you must be qualified on Swarm, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.

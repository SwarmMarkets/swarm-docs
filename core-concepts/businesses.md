# Business Accounts

As a regulated entity, Swarm employs institutional-grade compliance checks on all users, wallets and businesses. KYB or business verification is a mandatory requirement for financial institutions and other AML-regulated entities to verify the identities of their corporate clients.

By automating our know-your-business (KYB) protocol, we make the customer due diligence process more efficient.

A business account on Swarm is a fully regulatory compliant trading account similar in functionality to individual accounts, allowing businesses to trade without limits on Swarm.

**How to set up a business account on Swarm**

To initiate a business verification, a Business Representative must first fully verify their individual Swarm account to have an ‘unlimited’ trading limit.

Go to [Swarm Passport](https://trade.swarm.markets/passport) to check the current status of your account and to initiate a new business account.

There is currently no limit to the number of businesses an individual can verify on Swarm. Each verified business will need to link one blockchain wallet address to use as their transacting address.

The onboarding process for businesses usually takes 1-2 business days and Swarm does not charge a fee.

**Documentation**

As the applicant, the Business Representative is required to upload company and beneficiary data via the Swarm platform, including details of any significant UBOs or shareholders, holding over 25% control over the business.

Business Representatives are required to submit the following documents on behalf of the legal entity:

1.  A document confirming the legal existence of the company, such as:

    * certificate of incorporation/registration;
    * recent excerpt from a state company registry;
    * certificate of incumbency;
    * certificate of good standing;
    * memorandum/articles of incorporation/association/registration;
    * other similar documents.


2.  A document enabling the identification of all the UBOs of a company, showing the names of all directors and/or representatives of the company, such as:

    * shareholder registry;
    * statement of information;
    * recent excerpt from a state company registry;&#x20;
    * certificate of incumbency;
    * memorandum/articles of incorporation/association/registration;
    * trust agreement;
    * other similar documents.



The provided documents must, in any event, contain the company's name, registration number, legal form (type), address, and the date of incorporation.

If the entity has several corporate layers, i.e. intermediary holding companies, the relevant documents should be provided in respect of each company.

Bank statements are usually not accepted as confirmation of UBO status. For country-specific examples of acceptable documentation, please see below.

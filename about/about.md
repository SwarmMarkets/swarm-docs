# About us

## Mission

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Swarm-Circle (1).png>)

We live in times where technology enables individuals to come together in swarms to express collective behavior, which is decentralized, self-organized, networked and adaptive. With Swarm we aim to support these swarms in their expression of collective financial behavior.

### Guiding principles

* Enable customers to transact with blockchain-based tokens of any kind securely, cost-effectively, easily and at attractive prices in a future-proof environment.
* Provide new and useful financial instruments: Create next generation of financial products that improve, streamline and facilitate progress in processing, managing and securing financial assets.
* Customers should have free choice of counter-party and assets for transactions within the legal framework.
* Transaction validation is under the control of a party involved, and the fact of the existence of a transaction can be proven by it.
* Transaction metadata should be secret from third parties (with legal exceptions), but can be proven by the involved parties.
* Speed of transactions should meet business needs.
* Create a "trusted" financial infrastructure that is as trustless as possible and transparent to its market participants; our users can evaluate and validate its functionality and determine where it creates trust in the system beyond our organization.
* Leverage community-driven open source standards software. Its core elements will be a shared asset. We will contribute to and promote the development of open source technologies and their applications.

## Company Background

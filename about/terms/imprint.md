## Notices

### Liability for content

As a service provider we are responsible for own contents on these sides according to the general laws. We as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of appropriate violations, we will remove this content immediately.

### Liability for links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore we can not assume any liability for these external contents. The content of the linked pages is always the responsibility of the respective provider or operator of the pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to Liechtenstein copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are for private, non-commercial use only. As far as the contents on this side were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are considered. In particular contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you still be aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for a note. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such content immediately.

### Risk notice

The contractual opportunities presented on this site are not authorized for sale in all countries of the world. The information published on the Internet does not constitute an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. Persons who are not in possession of the necessary authorizations may not make any offers or requests for offers that relate to the information published on the Internet. The information is also not directed at such persons to whom such an offer may not be made by law. The information provided does not constitute an investment recommendation or an invitation to buy or sell securities and cannot replace investment advice. Despite careful analysis, Swarm Capital GmbH assumes no responsibility for the content, timeliness, accuracy, completeness or quality of the information provided. Insofar as forward-looking statements are made in the information provided, in particular with regard to the price development of markets or securities, these are forecasts. Liability claims against Swarm Capital GmbH, which refer to material or non-material damage caused by the use or non-use of the information provided or by the use of incorrect or incomplete information, are generally excluded, unless there is evidence of wilful intent or gross negligence on the part of Swarm Capital GmbH. Swarm Capital GmbH and persons or companies associated with it may hold shares in the companies mentioned or buy and sell positions in day-to-day business, which may result in a possible conflict of interest. Stock exchange futures and derivatives involve risks that can lead to a total loss of the capital invested. A negative development cannot be ruled out despite the positive results of the past and the necessary diligence of those responsible for trading. An investment in the aforementioned asset classes (stock exchange futures / derivatives) should be selected with a view to asset diversification and should only represent a small proportion of total assets. Historical returns are no guarantee of future performance. Stock exchange transactions, in particular transactions in derivatives, involve considerable risks. As a content provider, Swarm Capital GmbH is responsible for its "own information" that it makes available for use. Swarm Capital GmbH carefully checks and constantly updates the information on its web pages. Despite this careful control, data may have changed in the meantime. Therefore, Swarm Capital GmbH does not assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents of this website. Any liability of Swarm Capital GmbH, especially for possible damages or consequences resulting from the use of the contents of this website, is excluded. The same applies to links to websites of other providers (so-called "external links") and their content, which Swarm Capital GmbH provides in addition to its own content. The setting of such links is not done with competitive intent. These external links are marked as such. Swarm Capital GmbH is not responsible for the content of websites that can be accessed via such links. Swarm Capital GmbH has no influence whatsoever on the content of the linked pages and accepts no liability for the content of external links. Swarm Capital GmbH does not initiate the transmission of information and does not select or change the addressee of the transmitted information or the transmitted information itself. Furthermore, Swarm Capital GmbH does not automatically store these external links for a short period of time as a result of the linking and calling method used. The responsibility for the content of the linked pages lies exclusively with the operators of the websites accessed through the external links. Binding, warranty: All offers are subject to change and non-binding. Swarm Capital GmbH reserves the right to change, amend or delete parts of this website or the entire offer.

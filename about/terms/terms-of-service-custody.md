The Custodian has no obligation with respect to any Supported Assets unless such Supported Assets have been Delivered to a Blockchain Address provided by the Custodian. In addition, the Custodian is not required to accept Delivery of any Supported Assets, and has no liability therefor (except, if Delivered by the Customer, to ensure return by Delivery of such Supported Assets to the Customer), if the Custodian believes that the acceptance thereof would or is reasonably likely to expose the Custodian or any of the Custodian's affiliates to any liability (contingent or otherwise).

### 5.         Deposits

The Custodian is not liable for the loss of Assets due to the disregard of such obligations or loss of Assets prior to arrival in the Custody Account.

5.3       The Custodian reserves the right to refuse to process, cancel or reverse, any deposit in their sole discretion in accordance with applicable law and this Custody Agreement, even following deposit of Supported Assets in the Customer's Custody Account.

### 6.         Withdrawals

6.1       The Custodian offers (i) a full custody solution and (ii) a multi-sig solution.

6.2       Full custody solution

6.2.1    The Customer submits a Withdrawal Request to the Custodian via

6.2.1.1 the Custodian's Customer Interface; or

6.2.1.2 Email to the following address swarm@swarm.com, followed by a confirmation of the transaction data via a pre-agreed telephone connection.

6.2.1.3 Or any other method agreed to and verified by the Parties

6.2.2    Following either method, the Authorized Person will receive an email notification or other communication previously agreed to informing them of the Withdrawal Request. The Authorized Person must approve the Withdrawal Request through the Custodian's Customer Interface or via email, depending on the form of Customer's submission ("Withdrawal Confirmation").

6.3       Multi-sig solution

6.3.1    Upon submission of a Withdrawal Request via the Custodian's Customer Interface, all Authorized Persons will receive an email notification informing them of the Withdrawal Request. An Authorized Person (other than the Authorized Person who initiated the Withdrawal Request) must then approve the Withdrawal Request via the Custodian's Custody Interface ("Withdrawal Confirmation").

6.3.2    If only one Authorized Person is designated on an Account, a Withdrawal Request will be approved.

6.4       Once a Withdrawal Confirmation has been made, the Customer's Withdrawal Request will be processed within one Business Day of the next Cut-Off-Time.

6.5       With respect to the Custodian's Customer Interface and use of correct email address and other credentials, the Custodian cannot authenticate whether or not the Withdrawal Request originated from an Authorized Person. As such, Custodian may rely upon any action that they believe in good faith to have been taken by an Authorised Person. It is the Customer's sole responsibility to protect and secure their user name, password and other credentials from unauthorized use and disclosure.

6.6       Any Withdrawal Request from Customer's Custody Account shall only request delivery of Custody Assets to a wallet that is attributed and has previously been verified to the Customer or an Authorized Person and controlled by these. The Customer shall upon the Custodian's request evidence such attribution and control.

6.7       The Custodian has the right to refuse to execute any Withdrawal Request that the Custodian believes to (potentially) be in violation of any Applicable Laws and Regulations.

### 7.         Fees

7.1       The fee denominated in the respective Custody Asset type (the "Custody Fee") is: (i) calculated on a daily basis at 4:00pm CET; and (ii) accrues each calendar day against the respective Custody Asset Balance beginning on the day the Supported Assets were Delivered to the Custodian (i.e., becoming Custody Assets).

7.2       The Custodian will deduct the Custody Fee from the Custody Assets the Custodian holds on the Customer's behalf on a monthly basis, on or around the last Business Day of every calendar month, or more frequently, in the Custodian's sole discretion. The Custodian will deduct the accrued and uncollected Custody Fee from the Assets the Custodian holds on the Customer's behalf any time the Customer's Custody Asset Balance falls below the accrued but uncollected Custody Fee, including when the Customer withdraws its Custody Assets.

7.3       The Custodian may deduct an administrative withdrawal fee (the "Administrative Withdrawal Fee") in connection with a Withdrawal Request and in accordance with the Custody Fee Schedule.

7.4       The Custody Fee Schedule is incorporated by reference and is made available individually to Customers.

7.5       The Custodian reserves the right to change, modify, or increase the Custody Fee Schedule at any time. Any change to the Custody Fee Schedule will be posted at least three calendar days prior to taking effect and no change will be in effect for less than 30 calendar days.&#x20;

7.6       The Custodian maintains the right to retain or set-off any matured obligation due from  a Customer against any Custody Assets (or the value thereof, as reasonably determined in the Custodian's sole discretion) or any other satisfiable (erfüllbar) obligation (within the meaning of Section 387 German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch)) against any obligations that the Customer may have to the Custodian. If the obligations are in different currencies or Supported Assets, the Custodian may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.

### 8.         Forks

8.1       Forks may result in Forked Networks and the Custodian holding an identical amount of Custody Assets associated with each Forked Network.

8.2       Underlying protocols of Supported Assets are subject to changes in operating rules (each a "Fork") that may result in more than one version (each, a "Forked Network") and the Custodian holding an identical amount of Custody Assets associated with each Forked Network. Forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or name of the Custody Assets.

8.3       In the event of a Fork, Custodian may temporarily suspend the operations of the custody service (with or without advance notice to Customers) while the Custodian chooses, in its sole discretion, except as described herein, which Forked Networks to support. In our best estimation the Custodian is unlikely to support most Forked Networks and the Custody Assets of most Forked Networks will likely not be made available to Customers.

8.4       Digital asset values can fluctuate substantially which may result in a total loss of the value of digital assets held by the Custodian on the Customer's behalf. The supply of digital assets available to the Custodian to provide to Customers as a result of a forked network and our ability to deliver digital assets resulting from a forked network may depend on third party providers that are outside of the Custodian's control. The Custodian does not own or control any of the protocols that are used in connection with digital assets and their related digital asset networks, including those resulting from a forked network. Accordingly, the Custodian is not liable regarding such protocols and any change in the value of any digital assets (whether of a forked network or otherwise), and does not make any guarantees regarding the security, functionality, or availability of such protocols or digital asset networks.

8.5       The Custodian shall deduct a Daily Fee from the Custody Assets of each Supported Forked Network held by the Custodian on the Customer's behalf pursuant to the Custody Fee Schedule.

### 9.         Account Statements

The Custodian provides the Customer with an itemized account statement ("Custody Statement") monthly via the Custodian's Consumer Interface or via email, which will list the accrued Daily Fees for the Custody Assets.

### 10.       Refund and Cancellation Policy for Deposits and Withdrawals

10.1     The Custodian may cancel the deposit or withdrawal process at any time. Reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, technical error, market abuse, manipulation, prohibited activities and other circumstances referred to in Section 11 of this Custody Agreement.

10.2     Customers are entitled to refunds. Refunds may not be granted where the Customer is solely responsible for the cancellation or Assets are linked to criminal activity. The Custodian may deduct all fees and charges due from any refund.

10.3     In case the Custodian transfers to the Customer any excess Supported Assets that the Customer is not entitled to, the Customer agrees to inform the Custodian and transfer back that excess amount without undue delay.
